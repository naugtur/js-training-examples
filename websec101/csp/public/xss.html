    <p>Imagine this page was rendered by the backend which allowed for the XSS attempts below</p>

    <script nonce="tralala">
        alert("[good] Make this alert work with your CSP while others don't")
        const s = document.createElement('script');
        s.textContent = 'alert("[good] Can you make this work too?")';
        document.body.append(s);
    </script>

    <p class="userPost">
        Hello, I injected a script from my domain
        <script src="https://example.com/index.js">
        </script>
    </p>
    <p class="userPost">
        Look at me, I can inline a script in my comment!
        <script>
            alert('pwnd by inline script')
        </script>
    </p>
    <p class="userPost">
        This is more like what an XSS attack actually looks like
        <img src="a" alt="" onerror="alert('pwnd by more elaborate inline script')">
    </p>
    <p class="userPost">
        What if I got the backend to reflect some code and loaded it as local script?
        <script src="/xsses.js">
        </script>
    </p>
    <p class="userPost">BTW, if you want to see what attacking is like, try this game: http://www.xssgame.com</p>
